# 🍉🍍 Fruit Game: A Delicious Twist on the Classic Pig Game

Welcome to the **Fruit Game** project! This is a playful and exciting variation of the classic Pig Game, originally inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript tutorial. In this version, players roll fruits instead of dice to compete for the highest score!

## 🎮 Game Rules 🤩⭐

1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
2. On each turn, a player rolls a fruit as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score.
3. **Watch out!** If the player rolls a "1 fruit," their ROUND score is lost, and it's the next player's turn.
4. A player can choose to 'Hold', adding their ROUND score to their GLOBAL score, after which it's the next player's turn.
5. The first player to reach the predefined winning score (default is 100) on their GLOBAL score wins the game.

## ✨ Features to Implement 💡🤔

- **Mistake Prevention**: If a player mistakenly clicks 'Hold' before rolling a fruit, the game will alert them, allowing another roll.

- **Leaderboard**: A leaderboard will display the overall best player on the page, highlighting top scores.

- **Player Sessions**: Players can log in to view their records and achievements across sessions.

- **Two Fruit Mode**: I may implement a mode where players roll two fruits instead of one, adding a layer of strategy.

- **Score Penalty**: If a player rolls two "6 fruits" in a row, they lose their score, and it’s the next player's turn.

- **Custom Winning Score**: Players can set their winning score, for example, by changing the default from 20 to 40 points.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: The game will be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience on mobile devices.

## 🚀 Project Goals

This project not only enhances my JavaScript skills but also allows me to explore creative game development concepts. The fruity twist adds an element of fun and uniqueness, making the game more engaging and enjoyable for players.

## 🛠️ Development Journey

Throughout this project, I’m improving my understanding of:

- JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation.
- Creative problem-solving with custom game elements.
- Handling user interactions and errors.
- Designing responsive and user-friendly interfaces with a playful theme.

## 🎓 Special Thanks

A special thanks to **Jonas Schmedtmann** for his fantastic JavaScript course on Udemy, which served as the inspiration and foundation for this project. His teachings have been invaluable in helping me bring this fruity game to life.
